            Favorite Song to Play on Violin: ♥ Somewhere Over the Rainbow ♥ (Object not using flash)
        </h2>
        <p>
            I played the violin for seven years! I don't play anymore, but when I was younger this was my
            favorite song to play because it always sounded so sweet. So, I thought I'd share the love (and sheet music).
